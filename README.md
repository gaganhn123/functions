# Types of Functions

## Overview:
Import Statements:The contract imports three OpenZeppelin contracts: ERC20 for the standard ERC-20 functionality, ERC20Burnable to enable burning of tokens, and Ownable for ownership management.
Contract Declaration:The Gagan contract inherits from ERC20, ERC20Burnable, and Ownable.
Constructor:The constructor initializes the token with the name "gagan" and the symbol "G". It also sets the initial owner of the contract.
Mint Function:The mint function allows the owner to mint new tokens and assign them to a specified address. This function is restricted to the contract owner, as indicated by the onlyOwner modifier.
Burn Function (Commented Out):The contract includes a commented-out version of the burn function. If uncommented, this function would allow the contract owner to burn a specific amount of their own tokens.
License Information:The SPDX-License-Identifier specifies that the contract is licensed under the MIT License.

## Description:
Gagan Token (G) Smart Contract

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract for the Gagan Token (G). The Gagan token is an ERC-20 token that includes features for minting, burning, and ownership management. The contract is based on OpenZeppelin's ERC-20, ERC-20 Burnable, and Ownable contracts. It is licensed under the MIT License.
Features:ERC-20 Standard:Implements the ERC-20 standard for fungible tokens.
Supports functions such as transfer, approve, and transferFrom.
Burnable:Extends the ERC20Burnable contract from OpenZeppelin for burning (destroying) tokens.
The commented-out burn function allows the owner to burn a specific amount of tokens.
Ownable:Extends the Ownable contract from OpenZeppelin to manage ownership.
Ensures that only the owner can perform certain functions, such as minting new tokens.
Minting:Includes a mint function that allows the owner to mint (create) new tokens and assign them to a specific address
